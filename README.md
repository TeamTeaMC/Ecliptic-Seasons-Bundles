Ecliptic Seasons: MultiMod Patch


A collection of patches for mod compatibility with Ecliptic Seasons.

Description
This patch mod adds compatibility between Ecliptic Seasons and various other popular Minecraft mods. It introduces seasonal logic and environmental behaviors (such as crop growth changes, snow/rain effects, or temperature interactions) to mods that do not natively support seasonal changes.

The goal is to provide a seamless gameplay experience across mods that may otherwise ignore seasonal mechanics introduced by Ecliptic Seasons.
